# DegreeDropper
Degree Dropper Algorithm

This is a python module implementing the degree dropper algorithm based on 
page 197, Algebraic Cryptanlysis, G. V. Bard.

This module is used to transform a system of arbitrary high degree equations
over `GF(2)`, into an equivalaent quadratic system. This is done by introducing
new variables to encode high degree monomials and new equations relating them.
